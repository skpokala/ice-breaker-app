# Team Ice Breaker Questions App

A modern web application for randomly selecting ice breaker questions for teams, with comprehensive admin controls and analytics.

## Features

### For Teams
- **Team Selection**: Choose from different teams with color-coded interfaces
- **Random Questions**: Get randomly selected ice breaker questions from the question bank
- **Smart Filtering**: Used and skipped questions won't appear again for the same team
- **Question Actions**:
  - Use a question (marks as used, won't appear again)
  - Skip a question (moves to skipped bucket, won't appear again)
  - Get a new question without taking action

### For Admins
- **Question Management**: Add, edit, and delete ice breaker questions
- **Team Management**: Create new teams and reset their question progress
- **Analytics Dashboard**: View usage statistics and team activity
- **Usage Tracking**: See which questions were used by which teams and when
- **Skip Tracking**: Monitor which questions teams skipped
- **Categories & Difficulty**: Organize questions by category and difficulty level

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with custom CSS (Tailwind-like utilities)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: JSON files (easily replaceable with a real database)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Routing**: React Router DOM

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm

### Installation

1. **Navigate to the project directory**
   ```bash
   cd /tmp/ice-breaker-app/ice-breaker-app
   ```

2. **Install all dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm run install-all
   ```
   This will install dependencies for the root project, frontend, and backend.

3. **Start the development servers**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start both the backend server (port 5000) and frontend development server (port 3000).

### Alternative Setup (Manual)

If the combined script doesn't work, you can set up manually:

1. **Install root dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Install backend dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install frontend dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start backend server**
   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **In a new terminal, start frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```
